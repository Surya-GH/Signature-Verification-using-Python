## This is just a brief intro of our project...

Nowadays, person identification is very important in security and resource access control. 
Biometrics is the science of individual depending on their physiological and behavioral attributes. 
And handwritten signatures have been an integral part of biometrics which helps us in validating business transaction contracts and agreements. 
Among the different forms of biometric recognition systems such as iris, face, voice, palm etc., signature will be most widely used.
Signature verification contains two areas: offline signature verification and on-line signature verification. 
Offline signature samples are scanned into image representation by scanners or digital cameras, but on-line signature samples are collected from a digitizing tablet which is capable of pen movements during the writing.
Generally, the offline signature verification system is composed of four stages: image acquisition, preprocessing, features extraction and classification or verification. 
The offline systems are difficult to design compared to online signature systems because static image does not have many desirable characteristics such as the order of strokes, speed, and other dynamic characteristics. 
Therefore, the verification process depends only on the features extracted from the static image of signatures.

## This project can be used as reference for building further projects by using different modules and sensors.
## I Hope this project is useful...
